# Performing Sequence Labelling using CRF in Python

This is an example of using [pycrfsuite](https://github.com/scrapinghub/python-crfsuite) to train a CRF classifier for named entity recognition. For more detailed explanation, refer to the blog post at: [http://www.albertauyeung.com/post/python-sequence-labelling-with-crf/](http://www.albertauyeung.com/post/python-sequence-labelling-with-crf/).

Before running the script, download the data file `reuters.xml` from [https://github.com/AKSW/n3-collection/blob/master/reuters.xml](https://github.com/AKSW/n3-collection/blob/master/reuters.xml), and install the dependencies:

    $ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
