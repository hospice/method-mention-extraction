To prioritize the potential internal controls for Q-RT-PCR analyses and to study the possibility of general utilization of these potential internal controls , we first applied the <block bootstrapping technique> to rank genes with variance and IQR ( Fig. 1 ) .
The normalized and filtered data sets were clustered via hierarchical clustering with the <complete agglomeration method> and Euclidean distance metric [ 126 ] .
Redundant probe sets representing the same tentative consensus ( TC ) sequences or Unigene were removed and the 2,947 genes with significant differential expression patterns of 2-fold or greater were grouped into 12 clusters by hierarchical clustering using the <complete agglomeration method> and Euclidean distance metric according to mRNA expression within each tissue in comparison with the other two ( Figure 1 ; Additional file 1 ) .
As an initial <statistical analysis> , we used Affymetrix software to define genes that showed expression changes ( Increased , Decreased or Marginal ) in expression levels between pairs of profiles ( difference analyses ) .
For <statistical analysis> , we used the Significance Analysis of Microarray ( SAM ) software package from Stanford University [ 21 ] .
For <statistical analysis> we used a Bayesian linear model [ 40 ] and the Holm multiple testing correction to adjust individual p-values .
A <specific evaluation method> adapted to military syndromic surveillance objectives and conditions of engagement in the field was developed .
In this report , we describe a <new microarray-based method> for estimating the allele frequency in pooled DNA samples based on the physical principles of DNAs immobilization and hybridization on solid surface .
A recent publication described a <supervised classification method> for microarray data : Between Group Analysis ( BGA ) .
Whenever there is homology between species , there is an opportunity for identification probes with detectable hybridization signal using <probe level analysis> described here .
The <famous Lempel-Ziv algorithm> can efficiently extract the information on repeated patterns encoded in RNA secondary structures and makes our method an alternative to analyze the similarity of RNA secondary structures .
The <spectral method> is an indirect method which measures the magnitude of TA as the amplitude of spectral power at the 0.5 cycles per beat frequency and then subtracts the mean background noise .
In addition to this <indirect method> , we used a direct assay which measures the ability of peptides to promote the entry of a hydrophobic fluorescent probe ( 1-N-phenylnaphthylamine ; NPN ) into the cell membrane .
The spectral method is an <indirect method> which measures the magnitude of TA as the amplitude of spectral power at the 0.5 cycles per beat frequency and then subtracts the mean background noise .
The <qPCR technique> provides a quantitative measurement of DNA copy number and accurately characterizing chromosomal breakpoints .
( 3 ) Bisecting K Means ( BKM ) : The initial centroids are calculated using a variation of the Bisecting <K Means algorithm> [ 10 ] .
In the first stage , the <SVM-RFE technique> was most efficient and robust in the presence of low number of samples and high input space dimension .
The second generation of SS <prediction method>s started by the method of Garnier , Osguthorpe and Robson ( GOR method ) [ 12 ] and improved in several steps [ 13 ] .
We have developed a drug target <prediction method> based solely on protein sequence information without the knowledge of family / domain annotation , or the protein 3D structure .
A <prediction method> ProLoc-GO based on GOmining was implemented using the feature set of informative GO terms .
To avoid training data sparseness and to structure the hypothesis space based on the entire protein distribution , we have proposed a <prediction method> that uses Joachims ' spectral graph transducer and is trained on both structure-known sequences and structure-unknown sequences .
